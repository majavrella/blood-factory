Through the app, users can use amazing services and  invite others to join them on a lifesaving team. The 'Blood factory'  app is a great new way to help meet the constant need for blood.\n\n" +
            "The two-member team has developed a mobile app to match people who need blood with those willing to give it, instantly. One can download 'Blood factory' Android app from the Google Play Store  to join the network. Once a request is placed, 'Blood factory'  search potential donors based on location and blood group.\n\n" +
            "The country has a blood deficit of between 30% and 35% every year. In a land of 1.2 billion people it's ridiculous to say we can't meet the requirement, \"The problem is not insufficient number of donors, but finding a willing donor at the right time. We want to build a network of people who can help each other during an emergency";
