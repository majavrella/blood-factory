    public static final String about_us = "Have you at anytime witnessed a relative of yours or a close friend searching frantically for a blood donor, when blood banks say out of stock, the donors in mind are out of reach and the time keeps ticking? Have you witnessed loss of life for the only reason that a donor was not available at the most needed hour? Is it something that we as a society can do nothing to prevent? This thought laid our foundation.\n" +

        "Facts about blood needs\n"+
        "•\tEvery year our nation requires about 5 Crore units of blood, out of which only a meager 2.5 Crore units of blood are available.\n"+
        "•\tThe gift of blood is the gift of life. There is no substitute for human blood.\n"+
        "•\tEvery two seconds someone needs blood.\n"+
        "•\tMore than 38,000 blood donations are needed every day.\n"+
        "•\tA total of 30 million blood components are transfused each year.\n"+
        "•\tThe average red blood cell transfusion is approximately 3 pints.\n"+
        "•\tThe blood type most often requested by hospitals is Type O.\n"+
        "•\tSickle cell patients can require frequent blood transfusions throughout their lives.\n"+
        "•\tMore than 1 million new people are diagnosed with cancer each year. Many of them will need blood, sometimes daily, during their chemotherapy treatment.\n"+
        "•\tA single car accident victim can require as many as 100 units of blood\n"+
        "\nFacts about the blood supply:\n"+
        "•\tBlood cannot be manufactured – it can only come from generous donors\n"+
        "•\tType O-negative blood (red cells) can be transfused to patients of all blood types. It is always in great demand and often in short supply.\n"+
        "•\tType AB-positive plasma can be transfused to patients of all other blood types. AB plasma is also usually in short supply.\n"+
        "\nFacts about the blood donation process:\n"+
        "•\tDonating blood is a safe process. A sterile needle is used only once for each donor and then discarded\n"+
        "•\tBlood donation is a simple four-step process: registration, medical history and mini-physical, donation and refreshments.\n"+
        "•\tEvery blood donor is given a mini-physical, checking the donor's temperature, blood pressure, pulse and hemoglobin to ensure it is safe for the donor to give blood.\n"+
        "•\tThe actual blood donation typically takes less than 10-12 minutes. The entire process, from the time you arrive to the time you leave, takes about an hour and 15 min.\n"+
        "•\tThe average adult has about 10 units of blood in his body. Roughly 1 unit is given during a donation.\n"+
        "•\tA healthy donor may donate red blood cells every 56 days, or double red cells every 112 days.\n"+
        "•\tA healthy donor may donate platelets as few as 7 days apart, but a maximum of 24 times a year.\n"+
        "•\tAll donated blood is tested for HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and other infectious diseases before it can be transfused to patients.\n"+
        "\nFacts about blood and its components:\n"+
        "•\tBlood makes up about 7 percent of your body's weight.\n"+
        "•\tThere are four types of transferable products that can be derived from blood: red cells, platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitate. Typically, two or three of these are produced from a unit of donated whole blood – hence each donation can help save up to three lives.\n"+
        "•\tDonors can give either whole blood or specific blood components only. The process of donating specific blood components – red cells, plasma or platelets – is called apheresis.\n"+
        "•\tOne transfusion dose of platelets can be obtained through one apheresis donation of platelets or by combining the platelets derived from five whole blood donations.\n"+
        "•\tDonated platelets must be used within five days of collection.\n"+
        "•\tHealthy bone marrow makes a constant supply of red cells, plasma and platelets. The body will replenish the elements given during a blood donation – some in a matter of hours and others in a matter of weeks.\n"+
        "\nFacts about donors:\n"+
        "•\tThe number one reason donors say they give blood is because they \"want to help others.\"\n"+

        "•\tOne donation can help save the lives of up to three people\n"+
        "•\tIf you began donating blood at age 18 and donated every 90 days until you reached 60, you would have donated 30 gallons of blood, potentially helping save more than 500 lives!\n"+
        "•\tOnly 7 percent of people in India have O-negative blood type. O-negative blood type donors are universal donors as their blood can be given to people of all blood types.\n"+
        "•\tType O-negative blood is needed in emergencies before the patient's blood type is known and with newborns who need blood.\n"+
        "•\tThirty-five percent of people have Type O (positive or negative) blood.\n"+
        "•\t0.4 percent of people have AB-blood type. AB-type blood donors are universal donors of plasma, which is often used in emergencies, for newborns and for patients requiring massive transfusions.\n"+
