            "The plasma from your donation is replaced within about 24 hours. Red cells need about four to six weeks for complete replacement. That’s why at least eight weeks are required between whole blood donations",

            "With ageing, blood vessels start constricting. Bloodletting from constricted veins may lead to unnecessary pressure on hear resulting in many physiological problems. It is not known at what age blood vessels start constricting. It varies from individual to individual. Therefore, arbitrarily the retiring age is considered as the age of cutoff for blood donation.",

            "Though the blood collected from a vein is rich in carbon dioxide, it is transfused in the vein of the recipient and is automatically oxygenate in course of normal circulation and therefore serves the required purpose. Blood is not collected from artery for the following reasons: • Veins remain in the upper surface of the body muscle and can be easily identified while arteries remain in the subsurfaces and therefore cannot be easily identified. • Blood pressure in vein is low compared to that in artery. Puncturing of artery causes bleeding at higher pressure and velocity leading to trouble in stopping the bleeding after donation which is not a problem in case of vein. It is easier to pierce a vein.",
            "May or may not be exactly. But there should be a sort of relationship. We inherit our blood group from our parents by random combination of one gene from each of the parents. Dominant genes (A, B) prevails over recessive gene (O).",

            "Donated blood contains cells ranging from 1 to 120 days’ life span. Naturally, cells having such varied life spans cannot be preserved for 120 days in the bag since in that case there will only be a few living cells Present. In order to get a considerable number of living cells present in the blood for transfusion, 35 days shelf life has been found to be optimum with CPDA and CPDA1 solution on the basis of various experiments. Furthermore, cells which can remain alive for 120 days within the human body cannot survive for such period in an artificial environment.",
            "It will serve the purpose of volume expander. There will still be a considerable number of living red cells present in the bag which will be able to carry oxygen to the cells and bring back carbon dioxide",
            "Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Chandigarh, Punjab, Haryana at present. ",
            "U. K., Canada and Australia.",
            "Secretion of heparin by WBC inside the body prevents blood coagulation. But when tissues are wounded resulting in bleeding, a series of reactions takes place in the bled blood which ultimately forms a fine mesh of hard fibre within which the blood cells are trapped and the blood is thus clotted.",
            "Blood banks take only 350 ml of blood as your gift of love. ",
            "It is called anti-coagulant and prevents the blood from clotting. It also helps to preserve the blood cells. It is known as CPDA (Citrate, Phosphate, Dextrose, Adenine) solution. ",
            "Very occasionally a donor may faint. The most common reason is psychological and often due to rushing to get up too soon after donating. Relax and rest a little and you will be fine.",
            "Consider yourself invited!",
            "Blood donation has no ill effect on the body. You can resume your routine duties immediately after blood donation. The amount of blood donated is a small part of your surplus blood and is recouped by the body in twenty one days and you can donate blood again after 3 months.",
